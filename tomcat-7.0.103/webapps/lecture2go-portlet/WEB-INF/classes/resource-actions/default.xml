  The Lecture2Go software is based on the liferay portal 6.2-ga6
  <http://www.liferay.com> (Copyright notice see below)
  Lecture2Go <http://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de> is an open source
  platform for media management and distribution. Our goal is to
  support the free access to knowledge because this is a component
  of each democratic society. The open source software is aimed at
  academic institutions and has to strengthen the blended learning.
  All Lecture2Go plugins are continuously being developed and improved.
